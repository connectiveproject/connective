for image optimization, upload your image to either /original/small, /original/big folders, and run:
> yarn imagemin

your image will appear in "optimized" folder, in webp format.

images in "big" folder will be optimized more, and the quality would reduce.
images in "small" would keep high quality

then, simply use the images creted in "optimized" folder.
