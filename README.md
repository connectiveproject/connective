### Welcome
Welcome to _Connective_ - The Education Marketplace Open Source Project.

We'd like to thank you for investing time in the the project.

Your contribution brings us one step closer torwards making a true change in the Education System!

### Getting Started
1. Fork: Create a project fork using [this link](https://github.com/connectiveproject/connective/fork).

2. Open a Gitpod Workspace:
    * Gitpod is an amazing OSS platform for dev in the cloud (an in-browser IDE).
    <!-- * To start a workspace - whilst in the fork, simply click:    [![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/connectiveproject/connective) -->
    * How to start a workspace: whilst in the fork gitub repo, in the browserâ€™s address bar, prefix the entire URL with ```gitpod.io/#``` and press Enter.
    * That's it! You've got a VSCode with everything already installed and running!
    * More details can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started/).

3. Relax & enjoy the _Code Tour_, which will go through everything you need to know
    * You may find it in the bottom-left corner (see image). If not, check the note below.

### Notes
Our dev environment currently requires **a restart** right after creating a workspace.

To do that, simply go to: https://gitpod.io/workspaces/, **stop and start** the workspace.

We work diligently to fix the issue, which will be hopefully solved soon.


#### Happy Coding!
