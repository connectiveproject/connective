    * Gitpod is an amazing OSS platform for dev in the cloud (an in-browser IDE).
    * To start a workspace - whilst in the fork, simply click:

    * **That's it!** You've got a VSCode with everything already installed and running!
    * More details on starting workspaces can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started/).

### Notes
Our dev environment currently requires **a restart** right after creating a workspace.

To do that, simply go to: https://gitpod.io/workspaces/, **stop and start** the workspace.

We work diligently to fix the issue, which will be hopefully solved soon.



#### Happy Coding!
